# Endpoints

Endpoints enable you to easily integrate Axiom into your existing data flow by allowing you to use tools and libraries that you are already familiar with.

You can create an Endpoint for your favorite services like Honeycomb, Jaeger, Grafana Loki, or Splunk and eventually send the logs from these Services directly into Axiom.

Endpoints let you integrate Axiom in your existing services with minimal effort and without breaking any of your existing workflows.

If youâ€™re using our free personal plan, the endpoints are HTTP only. On our [paid plans](https://axiom.co/pricing) (team, and enterprise) the endpoints are HTTP + Syslog.**

## Configuring Endpoints

1. Create your **Dataset** on the **Axiom UI**.

- Click **Settings**, select **Datasets**, and create your Dataset.

- When you create your Endpoints, it will create a **target URL** with the specific endpoint name for you to **send data to**.
