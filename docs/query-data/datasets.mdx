The Datasets tab allows you to gain insights from your data visually.

Rather than inspect individual events, you can run aggregations across all or a subset of events in a dataset and visualize the output. Queries can be crafted to get any level of detail from results, and are easily saved for future use as well as being easy to share with team members.

This section introduces the Datasets tab and its components that unlock powerful insights from your data.

## Select a dataset

As all events in Axiom reside in a dataset, first choose a dataset to analyze. When no dataset is chosen, you are presented with a list of your datasets and quick-access panels for recent Starred Queries and Query History (see [Dataset Overview](#dataset-overview) for more detail):

![Datasets overview](/doc-assets/shots/select-a-dataset.png)

Select a dataset from the list of datasets:

![Datasets lists](/doc-assets/shots/select-a-dataset-from-list.png)

## Dataset overview

After selecting a dataset, you see an overview of the dataset, its fields, starred queries, query history, and the query builder:

![Dataset overview](/doc-assets/shots/dataset-overview-1.png)

### Fields List

The fields list gives an overview of all fields from all events that are in this dataset.

### Field Type

- Supported types are:
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - `boolean`
  - `array`
- Field names are flattened with dot-notation so an event like `{"foo": { "bar": "baz" }}` as a field called `foo.bar`

### Field name

Field names match the JSON specification. Field names containing periods (`.`) are folded.

If you get a 400 when you use the field name `_time` with the [Elastic Search endpoint](/docs/data-shippers/elastic-beats) or when you override the [`timestamp` field](/docs/usage/datasets#fields-list), use the query parameter `?timestamp-field` to set a field as the time field.

### Quick charts

Quick charts allow fast charting of fields depending on their field type. For example, number fields have quick charts for easily visualizing percentiles, averages, and histograms.

![fields list](/doc-assets/shots/quick-chart-1.png)

### Virtual fields

Virtual fields are powerful expressions that run on every event during a query to create new fields. The virtual fields are calculated from the events in the query using an APL expression. They’re similar to tools like derived-columns in other products but super-charged with an expressive interpreter and with the flexibility to add/edit/remove them at any time.

![virtual fields slide-out](/doc-assets/shots/virtual-fields.png)

Click **Virtual fields** on the toolbar to manage of a dataset’s virtual fields.

![virtual fields tool button](/doc-assets/shots/starred-datasets-2.png)

### Starred queries

Starred queries are queries saved for future use. They’re great for keeping a list of useful queries for a dataset. All starred queries are shared with your team.

Click **Starred queries** on the toolbar to manage starred queries.

![starred tool button](/doc-assets/shots/starred-3.png)

### Query history

Every query you and your team members run is given a unique ID and saved inside Axiom. Use the query history to share results with other members or find a past query that you want to star for future use.

Click **Query History** on the toolbar:

![query history tool button](/doc-assets/shots/query-history-1.png)

You see historical queries in reverse-chronological order. You can choose between your own queries or those of your team:

![query history slid-eout](/doc-assets/shots/query-history.png)

## Build a query

Use the query builder to create or edit queries for the selected dataset:

![query builder](/doc-assets/shots/query-builder-time-range.png)

This component is a visual query builder that eases the process of building visualizations and segments of your data.

This guide walks you through the individual sections of the query builder.

### Time range

Every query has a start and end time and the time range component allows quick selection of common time ranges as well as the ability to input specific start and end timestamps:

![time range](/doc-assets/shots/time-range-22.png)

- Use the **Quick Range** items to quickly select popular ranges
- Use the **Custom Start/End Date** inputs to select specific times
- Use the **Resolution** items to choose between various time bucket resolutions

### Against

When a time series visualization is selected, such as `count`, the **Against** menu is enabled and it’s possible to select a historical time to compare the results of your time range too.

For example, to compare the last hour’s average response time to the same time yesterday, select `1 hr` in the time range menu, and then select `-1D` from the **Against** menu:

![Time range against menu](/doc-assets/shots/compare-against.png 'time range against menu')

The results look like this:

![Time range against chart](/doc-assets/shots/time-range-chart-1.png 'Time range against chart')

The dotted line represents results from the base date, and the totals table includes the comparative totals.

When you add `field` to the `group by` clause, the **time range against** values are attached to each `events`.

![Time range against chart](/doc-assets/shots/time-range-chart-2.png 'Time range against chart')

### Visualizations

Axiom provides powerful visualizations that display the output of running aggregate functions across your dataset. The Visualization menu allows you to add these visualizations and, where required, input their arguments:

![Visualizations menu](/doc-assets/shots/visualizations.png 'Visualizations menu')

You can select a visualization to add it to the query. If a visualization requires an argument (such as the field and/or other parameters), the menu allows you to select eligible fields and input those arguments. Press `Enter` to complete the addition:

![Visualizations demo](/doc-assets/shots/analyze-visualizations-75.gif 'Visualizations demo')

Click Visualization in the query builder to edit it at any time.

</a>

### Filters

Use the filter menu to attach filter clauses to your search.

Axiom supports AND/OR operators at the top-level as well as one level deep. This means you can create filters that would read as `status == 200 AND (method == get OR method == head) AND (user-agent contains Mozilla or user-agent contains Webkit)`.

Filters are divided up by the field type they operate on, but some may apply to more than one field type.

![Filters demo](/doc-assets/shots/analyze-filters-900.gif 'Filters demo')

#### List of Filters

_String Fields_

- `==`
- `!=`
- `exists`
- `not-exists`
- `starts-with`
- `not-starts-with`
- `ends-with`
- `not-ends-with`
- `contains`
- `not-contains`
- `regexp`
- `not-regexp`

_Number Fields_

- `==`
- `!=`
- `exists`
- `not-exists`
- `>`
- `>=`
- `<`
- `<=`

_Boolean Fields_

- `==`
- `!=`
- `exists`
- `not-exists`

_Array Fields_

- `contains`
- `not-contains`
- `exists`
- `not-exists`

#### Special fields

- `_time` - the timestamp of the event. This is automatically set to system time if it’s missing from the event.
- `_sysTime` - the system time related to when the event was ingested.

`_time` and `_sysTime` can be used interchangeably for the majority of cases however, if your events do set a `_time` explicitly, the `_sysTime` can be useful to know if events are being ingested in case of clock skews on your event-producing systems.

### Group by (segmentation)

When visualizing data, it can be useful to segment data into specific groups to more clearly understand how the data behaves.

The Group By component enables you to add one or more fields to group events by:

![Group by](/doc-assets/shots/group-by.png 'Group by')

### Other options

#### Order

By default, Axiom automatically chooses the best ordering for results. However, you can manually set the desired order through this menu.

#### Limit

By default, Axiom chooses a reasonable limit for the query that has been passed in. However, you can control that limit manually through this component.

## Results view

Query results are presented beside the query builder in the results view:

![results view](/doc-assets/shots/results-view-700.png 'results view')

The results view adapts to the query that has been run and so it adds and removes components as necessary to give you the best experience.

The components that it can present are explained below.

### Status bar

The status bar is always visible and gives details on the currently running or last-run query.

### Charts

The charts component displays all the visualizations that you have added to the query. Hovering over charts gives extra detail on each result set.

On time series charts, hovering over a specific time shows the same marker on similar charts for easy comparisons.

### Totals table

The totals table is the totals from each of the aggregate functions that have run for the visualizations you have requested.

If the query included group-by clauses, there is a row for each group that’s part of the results. Hovering over a group row highlights the group’s data on time series charts.

### Matches

If no visualizations are added to the query, then the matches table lists the raw query results (events).

## Dataset view options

The dataset view options are under the settings icon when you run queries on your dataset. With the view options, you can visualize your environment, identify outliers, show raw configuration changes, and detect errors and warnings.

On the **View Options**, select and deselect the selections you want:

- Wrap lines
- Show timestamp
- Highlight severity
- Show raw

![Dataset view options](/doc-assets/shots/logging-dataset-options.png 'Dataset view options')

## Event timeline

The event timeline in Axiom’s Explore tab transforms your query results into a detailed distribution, providing a clear visual representation of events over time. It simplifies identifying trends and patterns while also offering a quick way to gauge total events count across a time range.

To get started with the event timeline, go to the Explore or Datasets tabs.

![Event Timeline](/doc-assets/shots/event-timeline-1.png 'Event timeline introduction')

Run a query on your selected dataset. When your query results are displayed, click the option to show the event timeline.

![Event Timeline run query](/doc-assets/shots/event-timeline-2.png 'Event timeline run query image')

The timeline shows the distribution of events across the selected time range. Each bar represents the number of events matched within that specific time bucket. Hovering your cursor over a bar reveals a blue line marking the total events and shows when those events occurred in that particular time range.

Click and drag your mouse over the event timeline to focus on the time range. When you do this, the time range for your data automatically updates to match what you selected. And if you change the time range in the **Quick Range** tab, the histogram updates too.

### Benefits

- Instant visual insights: Quickly understand the distribution of events over time without needing to interpret lines of text or numbers.

- Effortless number crunching: The distribution does the number work for you, showing total event counts and highlighting spikes, dips, and trends.

- Tailored data view: Adjust time ranges with ease, ensuring a customized analysis experience.

- User-friendly interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, no additional learning is required to use this feature.
