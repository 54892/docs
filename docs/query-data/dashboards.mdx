# Dashboards

**Dashboards provide a single pane of glass view into your data.**

Axiom provides a mature dashboards experience that allows collections of queries across multiple datasets to be visualized in one place.

![Dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/dashboards-introduction.png)

Dashboards are easy to share, benefit from collaboration, and bring separate datasets together in a single view.

This guide will introduce the Dashboards page and help you to create your first Dashboard and add queries to it.

## Dashboards Page

Select a private or shared dashboard from this page. A private dashboard is one that only you can see and edit, and a shared dashboard can be viewed or edited by anyone on your team.

Click the New Dashboard button to get started, you'll see a dialog that asks you for the name and a description of your new dashboard:

![new dashboard dialog](/doc-assets/shots/dashboards-page-1.png)

## Your First Query

Once a dashboard is selected, you'll be shown an empty dashboard page, with a call to action button that asks you to create a new query:

![new chart button](/doc-assets/shots/your-first-query-1.png)

Clicking that button displays the edit query slide-out, where you can create your dashboard using the **Simple Query Builder** or **Advanced Query Builder**. 

![new chart button](/doc-assets/shots/add-chart-1.png)

- The **Simple Query Builder** uses the datasets analytics tool to create your query and dashboard. 

![new chart button](/doc-assets/shots/dashboard-b.png)


- The **Advanced Query Builder** uses [APL](/docs/apl/introduction) on Data Explorer to run and create your dashboard.

## Chart Types

Dashboard chart type refers to the different kinds of visualizations that can be included in your dashboard to display your data. These charts help in interpreting complex datasets by visualizing the data in a unique way. With our supported chart types, you can track key metrics, logs, and traces, and monitor real-time data flow. 


## Timeseries

Timeseries charts show how data progresses over time. This can be a simple line chart, an area chart, or a bar chart. A timeseries chart might be used to show the change in the volume of log events, error rates, latency, or other time-sensitive data.

- To create your timeseries chart using the **simple query builder**, click on the simple query builder and enter the title of your chart, and select the timeseries chart type with the view type. 


![simple timeseries query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/timeseries-simple-chart.png)

- To create your timeseries chart using the **advanced query builder**, click on the advanced query builder and enter the title of your chart, select the time series chart type, and view type.


![simple timeseries query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/timeseries-chart-apl.png)

Timeseries charts plot the change in your data over time, which can help identify infrastructure issues, spikes, or dips in the data.


## Filter Bar

Filter bars are used to create context-specific filtering within a dashboard. They affect charts that are configured with APL using the filter ID through the dataschema, allowing more precise control over the data displayed.  When configuring a filter, you can specify attributes such as the `filter type`, `filter name`, and `filter ID`. These attributes enable you to select the criteria that can filter the data displayed in your dashboard.

- To create a filter bar, enter the title and select the **Filter Bar** Chart Type. 

- You can attach an image URL for your filter bar which allows users to upload an image from a URL to be displayed on the dashboard. 

![filter bar url displayed dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/filter-bar-preview-logo-url.png)

- In the **filter section**, select the filter type you want (currently, we have the **search** and **select** filter type). The select filter, allows you to choose from a predefined list of options to filter your data. You can decide to **list** or **query** your data. You can use a list value filter to view data from your status, method, or server, and you can use the Query list value to filter your data based on known, predefined criteria using APL.  

![filter bar url displayed dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/filter-bar-select-2.png)

- The search filter allows you to type in a keyword to filter your data. This is useful when you're looking for specific log entries, metrics, or events. For instance, you might use a search filter to find all logs that contain a certain error message or keyword.

![filter bar url displayed dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/filter-bar-search-3.png)

- The filters defined in filter bar are important for displaying the information on the dashboard. These filters are managed through a specific `dataschema`, which defines the structure of the data you're working with. For example, you can create a dashboard that uses the `filter_id` of type `string`.

```apl copy
dataschema filter_id: string;
['<dataset-name>']
| where <your-field> == filter_id
```

- In this example, we're creating a dashboard to get the `count of events` using the dataschema `__status` of the type `string`.

> Currently the dataschema in the editor will give you a warning, we're working on improving this support.

![filter bar url displayed dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/filter-bar-count-of-events.png)

After creating and specifying the type of filters you want, you can compare and contrast the performance of different errors, applications, or environments, or any other identifying attribute or tag in your logs, metrics, or traces data without needing to create separate dashboards for each.

### Handling Default (Null) Case

When creating a filter bar, itâ€™s common to include an `All` option for cases where no specific field value has been selected. Use a `where` clause to handle `null` values in this scenario.

For example, if your filter bar had a field ID `service`, the APL query might look like the following:

```apl
dataschema service: string;
['dataset']
| where iif(isnotempty(service), service_field == service, true)
| summarize count() by bin_auto(_time), service
```

Here, the `where` clause checks if a value is given for the `service` field, applying a filter if so, and effectively skipping the where clause if not. This approach ensures that all scenarios are covered, providing a complete view when no specific field value is chosen. 


## Log Stream 

The Log Stream chart displays your logs as they come in real-time. Each log appears as a separate line with various details. The benefit of a Log Stream is that it provides immediate visibility into your system's operations. When you're debugging an issue or trying to understand an ongoing event, the Log Stream allows you to see exactly what's happening as it occurs. 

The log stream chart can be created using the simple query builder or advanced query builder. 

- To create your log stream chart using the simple query builder, click on Simple Query Builder, enter the title, and select the **log stream** chart type. 


![log stream chart dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/logstream-simple-query.png)

- To create your log stream chart using the advanced query builder, click on **advanced query language**, enter the title, and select the log stream chart type. The log stream chart can also be configured from the cog menu in the explore view.


![log stream chart dashboard](/doc-assets/shots/log-stream-chart-apl.png)


## Scatter Plot

Scatter plots are used to visualize the correlation or distribution between two distinct metrics or logs. Each point in the scatter plot could represent a log entry, with the X and Y axes showing different log attributes (like request time and response size). The scatter plot chart can be created using the simple query builder or advanced query builder. 

- To create your scatter plot chart using the **simple query builder**, click on the simple query builder and enter the name of your chart, chart type, and view type. 

![scatter plot simple query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/scatter-chart-simple-1.png)

- To create your scatter plot chart using the advanced query builder, click on **advanced query language**, enter the title, and select the scatter chart type.  

![scatter plot advanced query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/scatter-chart-apl-2.png)

For example, you might plot response size against response time for an API to see if larger responses are correlated with slower response times.


## Statistic

Statistics charts display a summary of the selected metric(s) over a given time period. For example, you could use a statistics chart to show the average, sum, min, max, and count of response times or error counts.

- To create your statistics chart using the **simple query builder**, click on the simple query builder and enter the name of your chart, chart type, theme, line chart, and custom units.

![Statistic simple query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/simple-chart-statistic-1.png)


- To create your statistic chart using the **advanced query builder**, click on advanced query builder and enter the name of your chart, chart type, theme, line chart, and custom units.

![Statistic advanced query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/apl-chart-statistic-2.png)


## Table

The table chart displays a summary of any attributes from your metrics, logs, or traces in a sortable table format. Each row in the table could represent a different service, host, or other entity, with columns showing various attributes or metrics for that entity.

- To create your table chart using the **simple query builder**, click on the simple query builder and enter the name of your chart, and select the table chart type. 

![table simple query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/table-chart-simple.png)

- To create your table chart using the **advanced query builder**, click on the advanced query builder and enter the name of your chart, and select the table chart type. When using APL, the table chart type has the capability to display a non-aggregated view of events.

## Chart Options

### Values

The values section determines how the data points on your chart are represented.

- **Auto:** This option automatically decides the best way to represent missing or undefined values in the data series based on the chart type and the rest of the data.

- **Ignore:** This option ignores any missing or undefined values in the data series. This means that the chart will only display the known, defined values.

- **Join Adjacent Values:** This option connects adjacent data points in the data series, effectively filling in any gaps caused by missing values. The benefit of joining adjacent values is that it can provide a smoother, more continuous visualization of your data.

- **Fill with Zeros:** This option replaces any missing or undefined values in the data series with zero. This can be useful if you want to emphasize that the data is missing or undefined, as it will cause a drop to zero in your chart.


### Variant

The variant chart section determines the visual style of your chart.

- **Area:** An area chart displays the area between the data line and the axes, often filled with a color or pattern. Stacked charts provide the capability to design and implement intricate query dashboards while integrating advanced visualizations, enriching your logging experience over time.

![simple timeseries query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/area-variant-section-chart.png)

- **Bars:** A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. Bar charts can be used to compare discrete quantities, or when you have categorical data.

![simple timeseries query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/bar-variant-chart-1.png)

- **Line:** A line chart connects individual data points into a continuous line, which is useful for showing logs over time. Line charts are often used for time series data.

![simple timeseries query builder chart](/doc-assets/shots/line-variant-section-chart.png)


### Y-Axis

The Y-axis section determines the scale used on the Y-axis of your chart.

- **Linear:** A linear scale maintains a consistent scale where equal distances represent equal changes in value. This is the most common scale type and is useful for most types of data.

![Linear scale](/doc-assets/shots/linear-scale-y-axis-chart.png)

- **Log:** A logarithmic (or **log**) scale represents values in terms of their order of magnitude. Each unit of distance on a log scale represents a tenfold increase in value. Log scales make it easy to see backend errors and compare values across a wide range.
