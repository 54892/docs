The Stream tab allows you to inspect individual events and watch as they’re ingested live.

It can be incredibly useful to be able to live-stream events as they’re ingested to know what’s going on in the context of the entire system. Like a supercharged terminal, the Stream tab in Axiom allows you to view streams of events, filter them to only see important information, and finally inspect each individual event.

This section introduces the Stream tab and its components that unlock powerful insights from your data.

## Choose a dataset

Similar to the [Datasets](/docs/query-data/datasets) tab, the Stream tab requires a selected dataset. And so the default view is one where you can easily see which datasets are available and also see some recent Starred Queries in case you want to jump directly into a stream:

![Datasets overview](/doc-assets/shots/choose-a-dataset-1.png 'Datasets overview')

Select a dataset from the list of datasets to continue.

## Event stream

Upon selecting a dataset, you are immediately taken to the live event stream for that dataset:

![Event stream](/doc-assets/shots/event-stream-1.png 'Event stream')

You can click an event to be taken to the event details slide-out:

![Event details](/doc-assets/shots/event-slideout-1.png 'Event details')

On this slide-out, you can copy individual field values, or copy the entire event as JSON.

You can view and copy the raw data:

![Event details](/doc-assets/shots/raw-data-1.png 'Event details')

## Filter data

As with the [Datasets](/docs/query-data/datasets#filters) tab, the Stream tab provides access to a powerful filter builder right on the toolbar:

![Filter bar](/doc-assets/shots/filtering-1.png 'Filter bar')

It provides all the features of the filter bar in the Datasets tab. See the [filters documentation](/docs/query-data/datasets#filters) for more information.

## Time range selection

The stream has two time modes:

- Live stream (default)
- Time range

Live stream continuously checks for new events and presents them in the stream.

Time range only shows events that fall between a specific start and end date. This can be useful when investigating an issue. THe time range menu has some options to quickly choose some time ranges, or you can input a specific range for your search:

![Time range menu](/doc-assets/shots/time-range-selection.gif 'Time range menu')

When you are ready to return to live streaming, click this button:

![return to Live button](/doc-assets/shots/stream-live-button.gif 'return to Live button')

Click the button again to pause the stream.

## View settings

The Stream tab is customizable via the view settings menu:

![View menu](/doc-assets/shots/view-settings-1.png 'View menu')

Options include:

- Text size used in the stream
- Wrap lines
- Highlight severity (this is automatically extracted from the event)
- Show the raw event details
- Fields to display in their own column

## Starred queries

Similar to the Explore tab, the starred queries slide-out is activated via the toolbar:

![Starred queries](/doc-assets/shots/stream-starred.png 'Starred queries')

For more information, see [Starred queries](/docs/query-data/datasets#starred-queries).

## Highlight severity

The Stream tab enables you to process and inspect every log produced by your infrastructure, containers, and cloud environment. Highlighting severity allows you to track warning signs and detect errors from your resources and choose which logs to retain to maintain cost-efficiency.

On the settings view on the Stream tab, enabling **Highlight Severity** automatically searches for the words `warn` and `error` from the keys: 

- `level`
- `severity`
- `@level`
- `@severity`
- `message`
- `msg`
- `@message`
- `text`

![Logging codes](/doc-assets/shots/highlight-severity-1.png 'Logging codes')

The `warn` value is displayed with color `orange`, and the `error` value is displayed with color `red`.
