# Exploring your Data

Axiom Data Explorer provides a robust computation and processing power to get deeper insights on your data.

With the Data Explorer, you will be able to filter, manipulate, extend, and summarize your data whenever you want, without having to worry about query speed or indexes.

Data Explorer queries the same data you've already ingested into Axiom. [Learn more about ingestion here.](/docs/usage/ingest)

## Data Explorer Usage

- Select Data Explorer from the menu bar.

Configure your workflow on Axiom Data Explorer and start performing queries on your Dataset.

- A simple query has been performed on the ingested data as shown below.

![Data Explorer overview](/doc-assets/shots/simple-query-dashboard-1.png)

- The first line is the name of your dataset you want to turn your query on. Here, the name of my dataset is `http-logs`
- In the second line, we are selecting the `fields` to insert and embed into the new computed columns using the `project` operator.
- In the table below, you can see the output we got it returned a table that has the `field` named as arguments, and as many rows as the input table.

## Data Explorer Overview

Data Explorer's query language is APL, and it's a [data processing language](/docs/apl/introduction) that supports filtering, extending, and summarizing data.

Data Explorer has a rich query engine featuring the intuitive Axiom Processing language and powerful ingestion and storage capabilities that is optimized for low latency ingestion and super-fast query performance.

### Axiom Processing Language

Below are some APL commands to get you familiarized as to how APL queries look like on Axiom Data Explorer.

**NOTE:** In these queries below, the pipe symbol `|` separates the operations as they flow from left to right, and top to bottom.

**APL is case-sensitive for everything â€“ dataset names, table column names, operators, functions, etc.**

**Use double forward slashes `//` for comments.**

### APL Count operator

The below query returns the number of events from the `http-logs` dataset.

### APL Limit operator

The `limit` n operator returns a random subset `n` up to the specified number of rows. This query returns a thousand rows from `http-logs`, randomly chosen by APL.

### APL Summarize operator

The `summarize` operator produces a table that aggregates the content of the dataset. This query returns a chart of the `Avg(req_duration_ms)` and a table of `geo.city` and `AVG(req_duration_ms)` of the `http-logs` dataset from the time range of 2 days and time interval of 4 hours.
