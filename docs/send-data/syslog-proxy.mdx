# Send Syslog logs to Axiom

Logs are generated on all Network devices, Axiom Syslog Proxy ships logs to Axiom, acting as a Syslog server.

With Syslog logging system, you can monitor events on your devices and send them directly into **Axiom**, this also helps you retain your data logs.

The udp log messages is sent on `UDP` port `514` to the syslog server.

The tcp log messages is sent on `TCP` port `601` to the syslog server.
