# Send Cribl logs to Axiom

Cribl is a data processing framework often used with machine data. It allows you to parse, reduce, transform, and route data to and from various systems in your infrastructure.

- You can send logs from Cribl LogStream to Axiom using HTTP or Syslog destination. 


## Set up log forwarding from Cribl to Axiom using the HTTP destination

Below are the steps to set up and send logs from Cribl to Axiom using the HTTP destination:

1. Create a new HTTP Destination in Cribl LogStream:

Open Cribl's UI and navigate to **Destinations > HTTP**. Click on `+` Add New to create a new destination.

2. Configure the Destination:

- **Name:** Choose a name for the destination.

- In the Axiom UI, click on the datasets view and create your dataset by entering its name and description.

- **Endpoint URL:** Input the URL of your Axiom log ingest endpoint. This should be something like `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest`. Replace `$DATASET_NAME` with the name of your dataset. 

- **Method:** Choose `POST`.

- **Event Breaker:** Set this to One Event Per Request or CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed), depending on how you want to separate events.

3. Headers: 

You may need to add some headers. Here is a common example:

- **Content-Type:** Set this to `application/json`.

- **Authorization:** This should be `Bearer $API_Token`, replacing `$API_Token` with the actual API token from [organization settings](/docs/reference/settings#api-token).

4. Body:

In the Body Template, input `{{_raw}}`. This will forward the raw log event to Axiom.

5. Save and Enable the Destination:

After you've finished configuring the destination, save your changes and make sure the destination is enabled.


## Set up log forwarding from Cribl to Axiom using the Syslog destination

Before you get started, create your Syslog endpoint by following this [guide](/docs/endpoints/introduction)

1. Create a new Syslog Destination in Cribl LogStream:

Open Cribl's UI and navigate to **Destinations > Syslog**. Click on `+` Add New to create a new destination.


2. Configure the Destination:

- **Name:** Choose a name and output ID for the destination.

- **Protocol:** Choose the protocol for the syslog messages. Select the TCP protocol. 

- **Destination Address:** Input the address of the Axiom endpoint to which you want to send logs. This address is generated from your Syslog endpoint in Axiom and follows this format: `tcp+tls://qsfgsfhjsfkbx9.syslog.axiom.co:6514`.

- **Destination Port:** Enter the port number on which the Axiom endpoint is listening for syslog messages which is `6514`

- **Format:** Choose the syslog message format. `RFC3164` is a common format and is generally recommended.

- **Facility:** Choose the facility code to use in the syslog messages. The facility code represents the type of process that is generating the syslog messages.

- **Severity:** Choose the severity level to use in the syslog messages. The severity level represents the importance of the syslog messages.

3. Configure the Message:

- **Timestamp Format:** Choose the timestamp format to use in the syslog messages.

- **Application Name Field:** Enter the name of the field to use as the application name in the syslog messages.

- **Message Field:** Enter the name of the field to use as the message in the syslog messages. Typically, this would be `_raw`.

- **Throttling:** Enter the throttling value. Throttling is a mechanism to control the data flow rate from the source (Cribl) to the destination (in this case, an Axiom Syslog Endpoint).

4. Save and Enable the Destination:

After you've finished configuring the destination, save your changes and make sure the destination is enabled.
