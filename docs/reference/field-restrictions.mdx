# Field Restrictions

Axiom imposes restrictions on the number of fields that each dataset can contain. 

If a dataset exceeds the permitted field limit, an error will be generated. To prevent this, ensure that the number of fields in any dataset you are ingesting into Axiom doesn't surpass the allowed limit.

Please note that the specific field limit depends on your [Axiom pricing tier](/pricing).

## timestamp field

- It must be a valid UTF-8;

- The `_time` field in Axiom should either hold a valid timestamp or remain unspecified. When the `_time` field is left undefined, Axiom will use current time.

Axiom is designed to recognize a wide range of date strings and timestamp formats without any preliminary format specification. This includes widely-used formats such as Unix Epoch, RFC3339, and ISO 8601. This allows for versatile and convenient data input.
