# Axiom API

Axiom understands your resources and provides an API to ingest structured data logs, handle and manage your deployments. This is a **REST-style** API that uses JSON for serialization.

This page covers the basics for interacting with the Axiom API, plus instructions for ingesting data and notes on some commonly used endpoints.

If you would like to manage Axiom more completely via API, we recommend you use [axiom-go](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go).

## Authentication

You can generate an API Token/Personal Token in your Axiom user settings for manual authentication in shell scripts or commands that use the Axiom API.

Refer to the code sample below for an example of how to use this token in a curl request. All requests must use **HTTPS.**

### API Tokens

Axiom has two types of API tokens;

- Personal API Tokens.
- API Tokens.

### Personal Token

The personal token can be retrieved from the users profile page, all users have a Personal Token. With the Personal Token users can access the Axiom API programmatically for custom integrations, management setting, or for tools such as the Axiom CLI.

The personal access token grants access to all resources available to the user on his behalf.

Personal Access can be created under **Profile** or **Settings > Profile > Personal Tokens.**

### API Token

The API token is to used to send, and query data to one or more datasets. API tokens do not allow control of your organization, they are only used to ingest and query events.

using API Tokens, you can **Ingest**, **Query**, or **Ingest and Query** data to one or more datasets.

**For security reasons it is advised to use an API Token with minimal privileges only.**

You can obtain the API Token from the settings > API Token of the Axiom deployment.

## Sending Events to the Axiom API

To send events directly to Axiom API. We have the Go API client for your convenience:

- [Go Client](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go)

---

## Ingesting data

`POST /api/v1/ingest/`

Individual events are ingested as an HTTP POST request.

### Using curl command to ingest data

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/test/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[{"description": "string",  "name": "string",  "scopes": ["string"]}]'
```

## Body Specification

The body of the POST should be a JSON encoded object containing key/value pairs. As an example, to report a GET request from the users `/download path with a duration of 231ms and a response size of 3012`.

```json copy
{ "path": "/download", "method": "GET", "duration_ms": 231, "res_size_bytes": 3012 }'
```

---

### Commonly used endpoints

- **You can also [explore our REST API documentation and commonly used endpoints](/docs/restapi/introduction)**

---

Axiom supports ingestion of different data formats:

- application/json
- application/x-ndjson
- text/csv

---

## Examples

These examples send an API event to Axiom. Before getting started with Axiom API, you need to create a [Dataset](/docs/usage/settings#dataset) and [API Token](/docs/usage/settings#token).

## Ingest Events using JSON

The following example request contains grouped events. The structure of the `JSON` payload should have the scheme of `[ { "labels": { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value12" } }, ]` in which the array comprises of one or more JSON objects describing Events.

### Example Request using JSON

```bash

curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
        {
          "time":"2021-23-04302:11:23.222Z",
          "data":{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}
        },
        {
          "data":{"key3":"value3"},
          "labels":{"key4":"value4"}
        }
      ]'

```

### Grouping Events with different Labels

You can also group events with different labels into the same request as shown below:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System1",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T11:00:00+06:00",
        "elements": {
          "foo": "bar"
        }
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T12:00:01+03:00",
        "attributes": {
          "status": "202",
          "address": "/src.php"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System2",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T13:00:02+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "key2": "value2"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System3",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T14:00:03+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "key3": "value3",
          "status": "200"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]'

```

### Grouping Events with different tags

You can also group events with different tags into the same request as shown in the following example.

This request contains three events. The first two are tagged with `client1` and the third is tagged with `client2`:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
  {
    "tags": {
      "host": "client1",
      "origin": "data.log"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:05+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "method": "GET"
        }
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:01+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "statuscode": "200",
          "city": "Utsunomiya"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "tags": {
      "host": "client2",
      "origin": "data.log"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:02+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "country": "Mexico"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]'

```

### Example Response

```
A successful POST Request returns a 200 response code JSON with details
```

## Ingest Events using CSV

The following example request contains events. The structure of the `CSV` payload uses a comma to separate values `'value1, value2, value3'`

### Example Request using CSV

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/$DATASET_NAME/ingest' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
      -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
      -d 'user, name
         foo, bar'
```

### Example Response

```
A successful POST Request returns a 200 response code JSON with details
```

---

Datasets name are usually case sensitive, Dataset names must be between 1-128 characters, and may only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters and the '-' character.

---

Personal Tokens can also be used to ingest events, but the `org-id` must be specified.

**Org-ID** is the unique identifier of the organization on Axiom Cloud and it can be gotten from the `Axiom Cloud URL`

![Axiom org](/doc-assets/shots/orgid.png 'Axiom org')

In the above image, `axiom-t850` is the `Org-ID`.
