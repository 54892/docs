## What is a Grafana data source plugin? 

Grafana is an open-source tool for time-series analytics, visualization, and alerting. It's frequently used in DevOps and IT Operations roles to provide real-time information on system health and performance.

Data sources in Grafana are the actual databases or services where the data is stored. Grafana has a variety of data source plugins that connect Grafana to different types of databases or services. This enables Grafana to query those sources from display that data on its dashboards. The data sources can be anything from traditional SQL databases to time-series databases or metrics, and logs from Axiom. 

A Grafana data source plugin extends the functionality of Grafana by allowing it to interact with a specific type of data source. These plugins enable users to extract data from a variety of different sources, not just those that come supported by default in Grafana.
