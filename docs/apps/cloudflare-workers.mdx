# Cloudflare Workers App

Axiom’s Cloudflare Workers app provides granular detail about the traffic coming in from your monitored sites. This includes edge requests, static resources, client auth, response duration, and status. Axiom gives you an all-at-once view of key Cloudflare worker’s metrics and logs, out of the box, with our Dynamic Cloudflare workers dashboard.

The data obtained with the Axiom dashboard gives you better insights into the state of your Cloudflare workers so you can easily monitor bad requests, popular URLs, cumulative execution time, successful requests, and more. The app is part of Axiom’s unified logging and observability platform, so you can easily track Cloudflare Workers edge requests alongside a comprehensive view of other resources in your Cloudflare worker environments.

## What is Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless computing platform developed by Cloudflare. The Workers platform allows developers to deploy and run JavaScript code directly at the network edge in more than 200 data centers worldwide. This serverless architecture enables high performance, low latency, and efficient scaling for web apps and APIs.

## Sending Cloudflare Worker logs to Axiom 

The Axiom Cloudflare worker repository plugin is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudflare-workers).

1. Copy the contents of [src/worker.js](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-cloudflare-workers/blob/main/src/worker.js) into a new worker on Cloudflare.

2. Update the authentication variables to corresponding dataset and token:

```bash copy
const axiomDataset = "my-dataset" // Your Axiom dataset
const axiomToken = "xapt-xxx" // Your Axiom API token
```

- The dataset is where your Cloudflare worker logs will be stored. Create a dataset from the settings page in the Axiom UI.

- The Axiom token will be your API token with ingest and query permissions.

3. Add triggers for the worker, for example,, a route trigger:

- Navigate to the worker and click on the Triggers tab.
