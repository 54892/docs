The Explore tab provides you with a robust computation and processing power to get deeper insights into your data. It enables you to filter, manipulate, extend, and summarize your data whenever you want, without having to worry about query speed or indexes.

## Use the Explore tab

Go to the **Explore** tab.

Start performing queries on your dataset. A simple query has been performed on the ingested data as shown below.

- The first line is the name of the dataset you want to query. In this case, the name of the dataset is `http-logs`.
- The second line selects the fields to insert and embed into the new computed columns using the `project` operator.

## Explore tab overview

The Explore tab’s query language is the Axiom Processing Language (APL), a data processing language that supports filtering, extending, and summarizing data. For more information, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction).

The Explore tab has a rich query engine featuring the intuitive Axiom Processing Language and powerful ingestion and storage capabilities optimized for low latency ingestion and super-fast query performance.

### Axiom Processing Language

Below are some APL commands to get you familiarized as to what APL queries look like in the Explore tab.

In these queries below, the pipe symbol `|` separates the operations as they flow from left to right, and top to bottom.

APL is case-sensitive for everything: dataset names, field names, operators, functions, etc.

Use double forward slashes (`//`) for comments.

### APL count operator

The below query returns the number of events from the `http-logs` dataset.

### APL limit operator

The `limit` operator returns a random subset of rows from a dataset up to the specified number of rows. This query returns a thousand rows from `http-logs` randomly chosen by APL.

### APL summarize operator

The `summarize` operator produces a table that aggregates the content of the dataset. This query returns a chart of the `avg(req_duration_ms)`, and a table of `geo.city` and `avg(req_duration_ms)` of the `http-logs` dataset from the time range of 2 days and time interval of 4 hours.

### Axiom Processing Language resources

For more resources on APL commands, operators, functions, see [Introduction to APL](/apl/introduction) and the guide on [entity names and identifier naming rules](/apl/entities/entity-names).

## Query results

The results view adapts to the query that has been run and so it adds and removes components as necessary to give you the best experience. The components that it can present are explained below.

### Toolbar

The toolbar is always visible and gives details on the currently running or last-run query.

### Charts

The charts component displays all the visualizations that you have added to the query. Hovering over charts gives extra detail on each result set.

On time series charts, hovering over a specific time shows the same marker on similar charts for easy comparisons.

### Totals table

The totals table is the totals from each of the aggregate functions that have run for the visualizations you have requested.

If the query included group-by clauses, there is a row for each group that’s part of the results. Hovering over a group row highlights the group’s data on time series charts.

### Matches

If no visualizations are added to the query, then the matches table lists the raw query results (events).

### Event timeline

When you run a query on a dataset without specifying a visualization, Axiom displays an event timeline about the distribution of events across the selected time range. In the event timeline, each bar represents the number of events matched within that specific time interval. Hovering your cursor over a bar reveals a blue line marking the total events and shows when those events occurred in that particular time range.

Click and drag your mouse over the event timeline to focus on the time range. When you do this, the time range for your data automatically updates to match what you selected. And if you change the time range in the **Quick Range** tab, the histogram updates too.

### Table and chart options

To configure view options, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/options.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="View options icon" /> above the chart:

- Show chart
- Wrap lines
- Show timestamp
- Show raw

To select the fields displayed in the table, click <img src="/doc-assets/icons/brackets-curly.svg" className="inline-icon" alt="Fields list icon" />, and then click the fields in the list that you want to display.
